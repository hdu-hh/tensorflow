# An experiment to revive Tensorflow with Go

## Background

Tensorflow with Go is a match made in heaven, considering the power and elegance of
both projects. This is a reasonable assessment until you use the upstream Golang
integration for more than running existing models.

The upstream Golang integration has many strong points but
* it considers the Golang binding as [archived or unsupported](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs)
* even seemingly trivial code can cause direct or subtle errors
* coding with it requires plenty of boilerplate code and manual error checking
* delayed error reporting makes it harder than needed to find problems
* many operands needed for training non-trivial graphs are missing
* etc.

The `tf2go` branch is an experiment
* to remedy the most striking problems mentioned above
* to add convenience that is only available with TF's python integration now
* to allow running as "close to the metal" as desired

To use it you should start with these imports
    import (
        tf "github.com/hdu-hh/tensorflow/tensorflow/go"
        "github.com/hdu-hh/tensorflow/tensorflow/go/op"
    )

**`Documentation`** |
------------------- |
[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/) |
[Tensorflow with Go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go) Docs for the now unsupported community supported Golang binding
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an end-to-end open source platform
for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of
[tools](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/tools),
[libraries](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/libraries-extensions), and
[community](https://www.tensorflow.org/community) resources that lets
researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and
deploy ML-powered applications.

TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the
Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research organization to
conduct machine learning and deep neural networks research. The system is
general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains, as well.

TensorFlow provides stable [Python](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python)
and [C++](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc) APIs, as well as
non-guaranteed backward compatible API for
[other languages](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs).

to
[announce@tensorflow.org](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!forum/announce).
See all the [mailing lists](https://www.tensorflow.org/community/forums).

## Install

See the [TensorFlow install guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) for the
[CPU or GPU library](https://github.com/tensorflow/build/tree/master/golang_install_guide).

The [TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/) and
[TensorFlow guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/) provide some great
reading material. Most is focussed on python though.
